# 👋 Hey there, I'm Leila Yesenia (aka leilayeseniam)! 

Welcome to my digital playground! Here, I break things, make things, and try to understand the mysteries of the tech universe, all while having a blast.

## 🌌 About Me
- 🖥️ **Tech Enthusiast**: I’ve been passionate about computers since 1998, diving into the digital world headfirst and loving every byte of it.
- 💼 **IT Pro**: With over a decade in tech support and a recent deep dive into IT, I’m here to bring solutions to problems you didn’t even know you had!
- 🧰 **Tinkerer**: Whether it’s taking apart electronics or building a custom RV control system with Raspberry Pi, I’m always looking for my next project.
- 🚀 **Future IT Project Manager**: Gaining the skills and experience to lead with tech, creativity, and a touch of chaos.

## 💡 Why I’m on GitHub
I’m here because:
- **Learning Never Stops**: I’m always exploring new ways to build, automate, and innovate. GitHub is my sandbox for experimenting with code, collaborating on cool projects, and sharing what I learn.
- **Open Source Advocate**: I believe in the power of the open-source community—where knowledge is shared, creativity thrives, and everyone grows together. You’ll find me contributing to projects that inspire me or building tools I wish existed.
- **Showcasing My Projects**: From practical tools to wild experiments, this space is a reflection of my journey in tech. Feel free to take a look, get inspired, or even contribute!

## 🎯 Life Goals
1. **🌍 Travel in My Custom RV**: Hitting the road and living life on my terms, all while staying connected and working remotely.
2. **📚 Become a Master of IT**: Getting all the CompTIA certs, completing my bachelor’s degree in IT, and eventually conquering an MBA.
3. **🧠 Teach & Inspire**: Through Nexus Gizmo, I’m on a mission to help people navigate the digital world—be it beginners learning to use a computer or parents ensuring their kids are safe online.
4. **💼 Land My Dream Job**: Combining my love for IT and project management to lead exciting, innovative projects—especially in environments where I can make a real impact.
5. **💰 Financial Freedom**: Building multiple income streams, from rental properties to tech side hustles, so I can focus on what I love and retire young.

## 🚀 Fun Fact
I’m the kind of person who thinks of a Friday night spent optimizing my Raspberry Pi setup as a good time. And yes, I believe cats can be helpful tech assistants... except when they’re stepping on my keyboard.
